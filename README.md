# KLP-algorithm
 An implementation for verifying the straight-and-spaced criterion on a specific surface subgroup

# 
A finite presentation of this group was determined by hand. The list of geodesic words of length at most 9 was enumerated via the kbmag package in GAP (Thanks Teddy!) Unfortunately the list of words is a large file and cannot be easily stored on GitHub. Contact me if you want it.

# 
The numerical experiments are performed in NumPy.
